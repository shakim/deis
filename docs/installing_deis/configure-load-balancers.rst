Configure load balancers
------------------------

For a one-node Deis cluster, there is one router and one controller, so load balancing is unnecessary.
You can proceed with the next section: :ref:`configure-dns`.

On a multi-node cluster, however, there are probably multiple routers scheduled to the cluster, and
these can potentially move hosts. Therefore, it is recommended that you configure a load balancer
to operate in front of the Deis cluster to serve application traffic.

These ports need to be open on the load balancers:

* 80 (for application traffic and for API calls to the controller)
* 2222 (for traffic to the builder)

If you want to configure SSL termination on your load balancer, see :ref:`ssl-endpoints`.

A health check should be configured on the load balancer to send an HTTP request to /health-check at
port 80 on all nodes in the Deis cluster. The health check endpoint returns an HTTP 200. This enables
the load balancer to serve trafic to whichever hosts happen to be running the deis-router component
at any moment.

.. note::

  Elastic load balancers on EC2 appear to have a default timeout of 60 seconds, which will disrupt
  a ``git push`` when using Deis. Users can request an increased timeout from Amazon. More details
  are in this AWS `support thread`_.
